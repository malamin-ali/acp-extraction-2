__label__true employees ranked as professors or tenured assistant professors can select from ,  insert into ,  and delete from graduate admission related tables in the database . 
__label__true customer service reps ,  pharmacists ,  and billing reps can collect and use customer name and date of birth to help confirm identity . 
__label__true customer service reps can use credit card number for the purpose of updating records if requested by a patient . 
__label__true customer service reps ,  pharmacists ,  and billing reps can collect and use customer name and e-mail addresses . 
__label__true shipping reps can use customer name and customer mailing addresses to ship orders . 
__label__true billing reps can use credit card numbers for order processing . 
__label__true customer service reps can modify credit card numbers for order processing ,  if the customer is notified by email of the change . 
__label__true customer service reps ,  ducks or lawyers can use credit card number for the purpose of making treatment decisions if customer has opted-in .

__label__true the organisation may use email addresses to answer inquiries . 
__label__true supervisors can collect personal information if required by law . 
__label__true financial consultants can collect and use customer name for the purpose of confirming identity . 
__label__true financial analysts can use customer accounts to make loan decisions . 
__label__true management can report customer transactions if required by law . 
__label__false it is used to enforce authorisation rules on bonus allocation among the employees of a company . 
__label__false a bonus package with a fixed number of options ,  such as a-day-off ,  is available for employees . 
__label__true the director chooses options from the package to give to all employees . 
__label__true he or she also can read the information about the distribution of options . 
__label__true the director can promote an employee to be a  manager . 
__label__true managers can read and set ordinary employees’ bonuses ,  but not those of other managers or the director . 
__label__true an employee can appoint another employee to be his advocate ,  and have read access to his bonus information – for example ,  this might be useful if he needs help from a trade union . 
__label__false use cases such as record invoice arrival ,  verify invoice validity ,  authorize payment and write a check are to be applied in the specified order . 
__label__false each use case should be executed by an actor playing an authorized role ( s )  as shown in figure 1 . 
__label__true for example ,  write a check use case should be invoked by  ( authorized to )  clerk role . 
__label__false in addition ,  the role hierarchy implicitly authorizes a specialized role to inherit permissions . 
__label__false for example ,  according to figure 2 ,  supervisor role inherits purchasing officer’s permissions and purchasing officer inherits clerk’s permissions . 
__label__true supervisor can not  execute the write a check use case . 
__label__false no user should perform more than one use case on each object . 
__label__false this one type of dynamic separation of duty  ( dsod )  policy . 
__label__true for example ,  a user should not record and verify the same invoice . 
__label__false this policy is claimed to prevent fraud and errors . 
__label__true if the invoice’s total amount exceeds one million ,  then two different supervisors must authorize the invoice . 
__label__false a subject cannot belong to more than one role . 
__label__true every subject in the hierarchy except the business office manager can submit a project . 
__label__true every professor ,  except assistant professors ,  can review a project . 
__label__true a subject cannot review a project he or she has submitted . 
__label__true a professor can review the same project at most one time . 
__label__true only the business office manager and the dean can approve a project . 
__label__true a subject cannot approve projects he or she has reviewed or submitted . 
__label__true pc members and authors of papers are known to everybody . 
__label__true authors of papers cannot be changed . 
__label__true the pc chair appoints the pc members . 
__label__true a pc member can resign his membership . 
__label__true the pc chair can assign a paper to a pc member for reviewing ,  except if he is one of its authors . 
__label__true all pc members ,  except the author ( s )  of a paper can know who are the reviewers for this paper . 
__label__true the reviewer of a paper can assign the paper to be sub-reviewed by an agent who is not an author of the paper and has not been assigned the same paper by another reviewer . 
__label__true a reviewer of a paper can resign ,  unless he has already appointed a sub-reviewer for the paper . 
__label__true subreviewers are known to all pc members who are not authors of the respective papers . 
__label__true a sub-reviewer can resign ,  unless he has already submitted his review . 
__label__true there do not exist members of student who can assign externalgrades . 
__label__true all members of faculty can assign both internalgrades and externalgrades . 
__label__true no combination of roles exists such that a user with those roles can both receive and assign the resource externalgrades . 
__label__true requests for students to receive externalgrades ,  and for faculty to assign and view both internalgrades and externalgrades ,  will succeed . 
__label__true the sole counter-example shows that a student with the freedom to assign external grades is also a ta but not a faculty member . 
__label__true ta can view and assign internalgrades but not externalgrades  ( since faculty must take final responsibility for all external grades )  ,  combined with pol3 . 
__label__true all members of role faculty family can receive external-grades . 
__label__true if the subject is a faculty member ,  then permit that subject to assign grades . 
__label__true if the subject is a student ,  then do not permit that subject to assign grades . 
__label__true if the subject is not a faculty member ,  then permit that subject to enroll in courses . 
__label__true the manager has the broadest access to the information ,  including access to personal ,  financial ,  clinical and medical information about each resident . 
__label__true this does not mean ,  however ,  that she has unrestricted access . 
__label__true although she can enter the past medical records when a resident is admitted ,  she cannot subsequently add medical entries to the system . 
__label__false in the current paper-based system ,  this is prevented by requiring that any new entry be signed by the doctor making that entry . 
__label__true also ,  she cannot view the private notes of doctors and clearly she cannot sign the legal agreement on behalf of a resident . 
__label__true only the manager is allowed to add a new resident to the system and to start or update the care plan of a resident . 
__label__true the care plan is updated in consultation with the resident or the responsible person . 
__label__true only the manager is allowed to delete the information about a resident but here also that right is restricted . 
__label__false privacy laws require that the information be held for a certain period after a resident leaves the facility . 
__label__false this period is seven years for someone who is not of aboriginal or torres strait islander descent and nine years for someone who is . 
__label__true the health care workers are required to sign a confidentiality agreement before they have access to any resident data . 
__label__true their main form of access is to view the care plan for each resident and to add progress note entries based on their observations . 
__label__true access to emergency details is available for all staff . 
__label__true health care workers can view recent medical records of residents  ( up to one year old )  but cannot normally view older medical information . 
__label__true for a special purpose ,  access to an older medical record can be sought and obtained from the manager . 
__label__false because of the physical access control in the current paper system ,  the manager has an overview of who has accessed what information . 
__label__false in an electronic system this overview must be supplied by some form of logging of accesses and access attempts . 
__label__false clearly ,  the manager does not wish to be informed about every access but some logging is still necessary . 
__label__true so ,  for example ,  the manager should be made aware of repeated attempts by a health care worker to access information beyond their rights . 
__label__true a visiting doctor has access to all the medical information of residents who are his or her patients and can add entries to their medical records . 
__label__true doctors also can add private notes about a resident ,  which ,  on the basis of doctor-patient confidentiality ,  are not visible to health care staff or the manager . 
__label__false doctors need not sign a confidentiality agreement since they are bound by a code of professional conduct . 
__label__true occasionally ,  due to pressing circumstances ,  it may be necessary for a visiting doctor to examine a resident who is not normally his or her patient . 
__label__true this is permitted with the consent of the resident or the responsible person and the notification of the manager . 
__label__true the doctor then has temporary access to the resident’s medical records  ( but not to the private notes of the resident’s usual doctor )  . 
__label__false the principals involved in an information system are usually thought of as staff members of a certain organisation . 
__label__true privacy laws require ,  however ,  that a person should have full access to any information stored about them  ( unless the well-being of a third party would be jeopardised by revealing the information )  . 
__label__false in our case study this means that the residents themselves must also be regarded as principals for whom we define access rights . 
__label__false in the current paper system ,  all the information stored about a resident is accessible to the resident by arrangement with the manager . 
__label__false the need to make this arrangement is only to allow the manager and resident to set a time that is convenient to both of them . 
__label__true in an electronic system we can allow residents to hook into the network at any time as long as they can view only their own data and cannot make arbitrary changes . 
__label__true this includes the right to view even the private notes entered by a doctor . 
__label__false loading medicines to medicine dispenser ,  creating medicine order and picking medicines from the medicine dispenser are operations forming a critical task . 
__label__true this critical task should not be performed by a single user . 
__label__true a user should already grant diagnosing right to create medicine orders . 
__label__true only one user ,  here is the pharmacy system ,  can load medicines to the medicine dispenser . 
__label__true pharmacy system may get reports and status information of the medicine dispenser . 
__label__true however ,  it should not perform these operations when it is loading medicines to the medicine dispenser . 
__label__true pharmacy system can load medicines to the dispenser only at a time interval 12:00-13:00 in a day . 
__label__true only doctors and nurses can read patient records . 
__label__true pharmacy system should not read patient records even if it can read patient medicine orders . 
__label__true any subject with an e-mail name in the med . example . com domain can perform any action on any resource . 
__label__true a person ,  identified by his or her patient number ,  may read any record for which he or she is the designated patient . 
__label__true a person may read any record for which he or she is the designated parent or guardian ,  and for which the patient is under 16 years of age . 
__label__true a physician may write to any medical element for which he or she is the designated primary care physician ,  provided an email is sent to the patient . 
__label__true an administrator shall not be permitted to read or write to medical elements of a patient record . 
__label__true administrators can access only the administrative pages
__label__true guests can access all the public areas of the site
__label__true owners can access their account ,  move funds ,  and review transactions . 
__label__true users can view an owner ' s account ,  but not make changes
__label__true planners can access the sites financial planning and tax preparation functions
__label__true payers can use the site ' s bill paying function  . 
__label__true data owners can transfer ownership of information to other users . 
__label__true data owners can determine the type of access given to other users  ( read ,  write ,  copy ,  etc .  )  . 
__label__false repetitive authorization failures to access the same resource or object generates an alarm possibly and possibly restricts the user ' s access
__label__false special add-on or plug-in software required to apply to an http client to prevent indiscriminant copying by users  ( "cutting and pasting" of information ) 
__label__true users who do not have access to information should not be able to determine its characteristics  ( file size ,  file name ,  directory path ,  etc .  ) 
__label__false access to information is determined based on authorizations to access control lists based on user identifier and group membership . 
__label__true only administrators ,  not data owners ,  make changes to a resource ' s security label . 
__label__false all data is assigned security level that reflects its relative sensitivity ,  confidentiality ,  and protection value . 
__label__true all users can read from a lower classification than the one they are granted  ( a "secret" user can read an unclassified document )  . 
__label__true all users can write to a higher classification  ( a "secret" user can post information to a top secret resource )  . 
__label__true all users are given read or write access to objects only of the same classification  ( a "secret" user can only read or write to a secret document )  . 
__label__false access is authorized or restricted to objects based on the time of day depending on the labeling on the resource and the user ' s credentials  ( driven by policy )  . 
__label__false access is authorized or restricted to objects based on the security characteristics of the http client  ( e . g .  ssl bit length ,  version information ,  originating ip address or domain ,  etc .  ) 
__label__true staff can print on hp laserjet 1 . 
__label__true david can assign the manager role to alice . 
__label__true john can assign clerk to users from department a
__label__true clerk can read from database . 
__label__true owners can read name . 
__label__true clerks can add and change the name ,  the date of birth ,  the address and the postcode . 
__label__true owners cannot change any data but can read it all . 
__label__true there do not exist members of student who can assign externalgrades . 
__label__true all members of faculty can assign both internalgrades and externalgrades . 
__label__true there exists no combination of roles such that a user with those roles can both receive and assign the resource externalgrades . 
__label__true all members of student can receive externalgrades . 
__label__true if a subject is not a pc-chair or admin ,  then he or she may not set the meeting flag . 
__label__true if someone is not a pc-chair or admin ,  then he or she can never see paper-review-rc for which he or she is conflicted . 
__label__true during the submission phase ,  an author may submit a paper . 
__label__true during the review phase ,  reviewer may submit a review for paper if reviewer is assigned to review paper . 
__label__true during the meeting phase ,  reviewer can read the scores for paper if reviewer has submitted a review for paper . 
__label__true authors may never read scores . 
__label__false course registration requirements
__label__false version  2004
__label__false problem statement
__label__false as the head of information systems for wylie college you are tasked with developing a new student registration system . 
__label__false the college would like a new client-server system to replace its much older system developed around mainframe technology . 
__label__true the new system will allow students to register for courses and view report cards from personal computers attached to the campus lan . 
__label__true professors will be able to access the system to sign up to teach courses as well as record grades . 
__label__false due to a decrease in federal funding ,  the college cannot afford to replace the entire system at once . 
__label__false the college will keep the existing course catalog database where all course information is maintained . 
__label__false this database is an ingres relational database running on a dec vax . 
__label__false fortunately the college has invested in an open sql interface that allows access to this database from college’s unix servers . 
__label__false the legacy system performance is rather poor ,  so the new system must ensure that access to the data on the legacy system occurs in a timely manner . 
__label__true the new system will access course information from the legacy database but will not update it . 
__label__false the registrar’s office will continue to maintain course information through another system . 
__label__true at the beginning of each semester ,  students may request a course catalogue containing a list of course offerings for the semester . 
__label__true information about each course ,  such as professor ,  department ,  and prerequisites ,  will be included to help students make informed decisions . 
__label__true the new system will allow students to select four course offerings for the coming semester . 
__label__true in addition ,  each student will indicate two alternative choices in case the student cannot be assigned to a primary selection . 
__label__false course offerings will have a maximum of ten students and a minimum of three students . 
__label__false a course offering with fewer than three students will be canceled . 
__label__true for each semester ,  there is a period of time that students can change their schedule . 
__label__true students must be able to access the system during this time to add or drop courses . 
__label__true once the registration process is completed for a student ,  the registration system sends information to the billing system so the student can be billed for the semester . 
__label__true if a course fills up during the actual registration process ,  the student must be notified of the change before submitting the schedule for processing . 
__label__true at the end of the semester ,  the student will be able to access the system to view an electronic report card . 
__label__false since student grades are sensitive information ,  the system must employ extra security measures to prevent unauthorized access . 
__label__true professors must be able to access the on-line system to indicate which courses they will be teaching . 
__label__true they will also need to see which students signed up for their course offerings . 
__label__true in addition ,  the professors will be able to record the grades for the students in each class . 
__label__false introduction
__label__false glossary
__label__false this document is used to define terminology specific to the problem domain ,  explaining terms ,  which may be unfamiliar to the reader of the use-case descriptions or other project documents .

__label__false objectives
__label__false supplementary specification
__label__false the purpose of this document is to define requirements of the course registration system . 
__label__false this supplementary specification lists the requirements that are not readily captured in the use cases of the use- case model . 
__label__false the supplementary specifications and the use-case model together capture a complete set of requirements on the system . 
__label__false scope
__label__false this supplementary specification applies to the course registration system ,  which will be developed by the ooad students . 
__label__false this specification defines the non-functional requirements of the system; such as reliability ,  usability ,  performance ,  and supportability ,  as well as functional requirements that are common across a number of use cases . 
__label__false  ( the functional requirements are defined in the use case specifications .  ) 
__label__false references
__label__false none . 
__label__false functionality
__label__false multiple users must be able to perform their work concurrently . 
__label__true if a course offering becomes full while a student is building a schedule including that offering ,  the student must be notified . 
__label__false usability
__label__false the desktop user-interface shall be windows 95 or 98 compliant . 
__label__false reliability
__label__false the system shall be available 24 hours a day 7 days a week ,  with no more than 10% down time .

__label__false the system shall support up to 2000 simultaneous users against the central database at any given time ,  and up to 500 simultaneous users against the local servers at any one time . 
__label__false the system shall provide access to the legacy course catalog database with no more than a 10 second latency . 
__label__false note: risk-based prototypes have found that the legacy course catalog database cannot meet our performance needs without some creative use of mid-tier processing power
__label__false the system must be able to complete 80% of all transactions within 2 minutes . 
__label__false supportability
__label__false none . 
__label__false security
__label__true the system must prevent students from changing any schedules other than their own ,  and professors from modifying assigned course offerings for other professors . 
__label__true only professors can enter grades for students . 
__label__true only the registrar is allowed to change any student information . 
__label__false design constraints
__label__false the system shall integrate with an existing legacy system ,  the course catalog system ,  which is an rdbms database . 
__label__false the system shall provide a windows-based desktop interface . 
__label__false use-case model
__label__false course registration system use-case model main diagram
__label__false close registration
__label__false brief description
__label__true this use case allows a registrar to close the registration process . 
__label__false course offerings that do not have enough students are cancelled . 
__label__false course offerings must have a minimum of three students in them . 
__label__true the billing system is notified for each student in each course offering that is not cancelled ,  so the student can be billed for the course offering . 
__label__false flow of events
__label__false basic flow
__label__true this use case starts when the registrar requests that the system close registration . 
__label__the system checks to see if registration is in progress .  1 )  
__label__true if it is ,  then a message is displayed to the registrar ,  and the use case terminates . 
__label__true the close registration processing cannot be performed if registration is in progress . 
__label__true 2 )  for each course offering ,  the system checks if a professor has signed up to teach the course offering and at least three students have registered . 
__label__true if so ,  the system commits the course offering for each schedule that contains it . 
__label__true 3 )  for each schedule ,  the system levels the schedule: if the schedule does not have the maximum number of primary courses selected ,  the system attempts to select alternates from the schedule’s list of alternates . 
__label__true the first available alternate course offerings will be selected . 
__label__true if no alternates are available ,  then no substitution will be made . 
__label__true 4 )  for each course offering ,  the system closes all course offerings . 
__label__true if the course offerings do not have at least three students at this point  ( some may have been added as a result of leveling )  ,  then the system cancels the course offering . 
__label__true the system cancels the course offering for each schedule that contains it . 
__label__true 5 )  the system calculates the tuition owed by each student for his current semester schedule and sends a transaction to the billing system . 
__label__true the billing system will send the bill to the students ,  which will include a copy of their final schedule . 
__label__false alternative flows
__label__false no professor for the course offering
__label__true if ,  in the basic flow ,  there is no professor signed up to teach the course offering ,  the system will cancel the course offering . 
__label__true the system cancels the course offering for each schedule that contains it . 
__label__false billing system unavailable
__label__false if the system is unable to communicate with the billing system ,  the system will attempt to re-send the request after a specified period . 
__label__false the system will continue to attempt to re-send until the billing system becomes available . 
__label__false special requirements
__label__false none . 
__label__false pre-conditions

__label__false alternative flows
__label__false professor not found
__label__true if ,  in the update a professor  or delete a professor sub-flows ,  a professor with the specified id number does not exist ,  the system displays an error message . 
__label__true the registrar can then enter a different id number or cancel the operation ,  at which point the use case ends . 
__label__false delete cancelled

__label__false 1 introduction . 
__label__true this project involves the development of an application through which doctors can obtain and share essential patient information and can view aggregate patient data . 
__label__false currently ,  access to a patient ' s history regarding previous medical problems ,  previous surgery ,  medications ,  allergies and other factors is often difficult or obtainable only from a patient ' s recollection . 
__label__false now ,  as more hospitals and doctor ' s offices are automated ,  this information is available electronically . 
__label__false however ,  it is not accessible by other doctors ,  and is often only viewed through some proprietary software so it can not be shared . 
__label__true the final product is a site where health care workers can access important patient information ,  the non-emergency access can be controlled ,  and all access would be tracked . 
__label__false security and privacy of such a system is of paramount importance . 
__label__true hipaa rules protect patients '  information and also allow a patient to dictate who can access this information . 
__label__false 2 glossary . 
__label__true approved diagnostic information: the set of diagnostic information a patient allows a designated or other licensed health care professional to view . 
__label__true a patient is only given the choice to restrict viewing on selected diagnostic information ,  such as those related to mental illness ,  substance abuse ,  and cosmetic surgery . 
__label__true the licensed health care professional making a diagnosis determines if a patient is granted the ability to restrict viewing of the diagnosis . 
__label__true for the diagnostic information which a patient can restrict viewing ,  he or she can choose to enable designated licensed health care professionals ,  possibly and possibly other licensed health care professionals ,  possibly and possibly no one . 
__label__false there are ten roles in the itrust medical records system . 
__label__false the role of a user determines their viewing and editing capabilities  ( role-based access control )  . 
__label__false health care personnel  ( hcp ) : all of designated licensed health care professionals ,  licensed health care professionals ,  and unlicensed authorized personnel ,  as defined below . 
__label__false patient: when an american infant is born or a foreigner requests medical care ,  each is assigned a medical identification number and password . 
__label__false then ,  this person ' s electronic records are accessible via the itrust medical records system . 
__label__true administrator: the administrator assigns medical identification numbers and passwords to lhcps . 
__label__true licensed health care professional  ( lhcp ) : a licensed health care professional that is allowed by a particular patient to view all approved medical records . 
__label__false in general ,  a patient does not know this non-designated health care professional ,  such as an emergency room doctor ,  and the set of approved records may be smaller than that granted to a designated licensed health care professional . 
__label__true designated licensed health care professional  ( dlhcp ) : a licensed health care professional that is allowed by a particular patient to view all approved medical records . 
__label__false any lhcp can be a dlhcp to some patients  ( with whom he or she has an established relationship )  and an lhcp to others  ( whom he or she has never or rarely seen before )  . 
__label__false emergency responder  ( er ) : police ,  fire ,  emergency medical technicians  ( emts )  ,  and other medically trained emergency responders who provide care while at ,  or in transport from ,  the site of an emergency . 
__label__false [referred to as "on site care providers" by department of health and human services emergency responder electronic health record use case department of health and human services . 
__label__false unlicensed authorized personnel  ( uap ) : a health care worker such as a medical secretary ,  case manager ,  care coordinator ,  or other authorized clerical-type personnel . 
__label__true an unlicensed personnel can enter and edit demographic information ,  diagnosis ,  office visit notes and other medical information ,  and can view records . 
__label__false software tester: an information technology worker who tests the itrust medical records system . 
__label__false of particular interest to the software tester is the operational profile information which informs him or her of the frequency of use of the features of the system . 
__label__false personal representative: a person legally authorized to make health care decisions on an individual ' s behalf or to act for a deceased individual . 
__label__true when a person logs into itrust ,  if he or she is a personal representative ,  they view their own records or those of the person or people they are representing . 
__label__false  ( for example ,  a mother could choose herself and any one of her children .  ) 
__label__true public health agent: a person legally authorized view and respond to reports of adverse events . 
__label__false lab technician  ( lt ) : a clinical worker that runs diagnostic tests on samples gathered from patients during office visits . 
__label__false the lab technician can specialize in blood work ,  tissue work ,  or general . 
__label__false these are the standards codes used within itrust: . 
__label__false icd-9cm: the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems  ( most commonly known by the abbreviation icd )  provides codes to classify diseases and a wide variety of signs ,  symptoms ,  abnormal findings ,  complaints ,  social circumstances and external causes of injury or disease . 
__label__false nhcs classification of diseases ,  functioning and disability . 
__label__false nd: the national drug code  ( ndc )  is a universal product identifier used in the united states for drugs intended for human use .

__label__false loinc: logical observation identifiers names and codes  ( loinc )  is a database and universal standard for identifying medical laboratory observations . 
__label__false cpt: the cpt code set accurately describes medical ,  surgical ,  and diagnostic services and is designed to communicate uniform information about medical services and procedures among physicians ,  coders ,  patients ,  accreditation organizations ,  and payers for administrative ,  financial ,  and analytical purposes .
